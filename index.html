    <p class="tagline"> Our Vision is a to create a mobile community of like-minded people who chase their dreams of their lowest round or a hole in one!<br><br> 

A Good Walk LLC was formed to be able to provide people who love to play the game of golf, enjoy the camaraderie with friends, family and colleagues as they play and share their experiences playing golf and for those who also want the ability to capture their golfing experiences on their mobile device. The concept to be able to memorialize, share and display the great times had chasing a golf ball around many different gold venues is priceless.
<br><br>

When we say capture golfing experiences; we have identified that as: capturing course(s) played, dates played and with who, scores, pictures, videos, and games or tournaments outcomes of each experience. 
 <br><br>
Related data such as; where a mobile app subscriber might have dined, lodged, if applicable; weather conditions and the like can also be captured to memorialize the golf round, golf trip and total experience.  </p>
